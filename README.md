#  Mounting GoogleDrive 
You will need to add a shortcut to this Google shared folder to your own Google Drive to be able to access the dataset, the saved models, nad saved output statistics:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IypaLVub6Mk9A0AO_hN3wv5yEY04JNin

As well as going through this list of shared folders so that your drive recognized you have access to them (they are allshared as "has-link-can-view", but your GGDrive still need to recognize that you have the access)

Also, you may need to make sure you are using the correct "directory cells" //
We have 2 sets: 
The 1st for read/write directly our shared folders, which our team members use. ("/content/drive/[...]") //
The 2nd for writing on the runtime temporary content directory of Google Colab. ("/content") //
